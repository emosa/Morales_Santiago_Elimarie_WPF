// Assignment: Functions

// function with more than one parameter

function savings(ten, twenty, thirty){// function with parameters
    alert("If I make the effort and save some" + " " + ten +" "+ "by December I can finally" + " " + twenty + " "+ "my new" +" "+ thirty);// alert with parameters
}

savings("money", "buy", "car!");// called parameters


// added another exersice honestly I couldn't figure out how to put the functions together with the loops.


var whatToEat = ["Taco", "Pizza", "Fruits", "Vegetables"];//declares the array has 4 elements

for (var i = 0; i < whatToEat.length; i++) { //loop starts will run until i < 4 and it will stop once i is no longer less than what to eat
    console.log("I would like to eat " + whatToEat[i]);// print out what to eat because
}
