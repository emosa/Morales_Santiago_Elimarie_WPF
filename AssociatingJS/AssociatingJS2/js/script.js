// Condition logic -  with an expression (else)



var kidHeight= 52;
var miheight = 48;

// if the child is old, enough, print to console "you can ride!"

// if the kid is over 48 inches height

if(kidHeight > miheight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}else{
    //code performed if condition is false
    console.log("Sorry kid, you've got some growing to do first! ");
