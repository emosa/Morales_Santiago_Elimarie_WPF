// How much water my fish tank holds?

var depthInches= 28; // Distance from front to back of the fish tank
var widhtInches= 14; // Distance across the front to back of the fish tank
var heightInches= 18; // Distance from top to bottom of the fish tank

var total= depthInches * widhtInches * heightInches; // Multiplying total measurements for a total of 7056

var gallonsub= total * 0.00433; // Calculating total measurements multiplied by cubic inches 0.00433 equal to 30.55248 that is approximately 30.55 gallons

var watergallon= "My fish tank holds" +" "+ gallonsub + " " + "gallons of water."; // This is the result of all calculations

console.log(watergallon); // My fish tank holds 30.55248 gallons of water.

//Since I didn't commit 20 times I am doing another expression
